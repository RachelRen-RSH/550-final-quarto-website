## Overview

We can create beautiful websites that describe complex technical analyses in Python using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) 
and deploy them online using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This combination of tools is a really powerful way 
to create and share your work. This website is a demo that is meant to be used to create your own Quarto website for the 
final project in MUSA 550. 

Quarto is a relatively new tool, but is becoming popular quickly. It's a successor 
to the Rmarkdown ecosystem that combines functionality into a single tool and also extends its computation power to other
languages. Most importantly for us, Quarto supports executing Python code, allowing us to convert Jupyter notebooks to HTML and share them online.
