Web Scraping\nTo retrieve the hotel prices during the Christmas holiday season in Miami, we web-scraped Expedia.com, an official website of booking stays and flights, by selecting a one-night stay from December 24th to December 25th in 2023 with one traveler and one room. We used Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract the information of hotel names, ratings, amenities, and prices from the HTML tags and classes and generated a dataframe with the cleaned data.\n\n\n\nExpedia Query Result Screenshot\n\n\n\n\n2. Google Geocoding API\nSince the web-scraped results do not include specific addresses or coordinates of hotels, we used Google Geocoding API to geocode the addresses from the hotel names. Then we withdrawed the coordinates from the geocoding results and joined them by hotel names into the hotel’s dataframe to create a geodataframe with geometries.\n\n\n3. Census API\nIt is possible that a hotel’s price is related with the wealth level of the belonged neighborhood. Therefore, we retrieved the median household income data by census tracts and joined it with the hotel dataframe.\n\n\n4. ArcGIS Open Data\nSpatial features of parks, shorelines, matro stations, trash complaints, abandoned cars and properties and sexual offenders are all retrieved from County of Miami-Dade ArcGIS Open Data Portal. We performed a nearest-neighborhood analysis to calculate the distance from each hotel to its nearest neighbor in the these datasets. We did a logarithm of the distances to normalize the distribution of distance values."

To enhance the experience of visitors to this tropical paradise, our team created an application to help tourists eliminate worries about choosing hotels, which can both save money and time. It is not only a travel companion, but also it’s a smart, personalized guide to ensuring a joyful and stress-free holiday experience in Miami’s festive ambiance.\nOur application offers two unique and attractive features. Firstly, we provide an in-depth analysis of the correlations between hotel holiday prices in 2023 and various factors such as their ratings, amenities, and the surrounding environment or demographics in Miami. This allows visitors to understand what influences the cost of their stay and whether there are some outliers that the price do not relates with the adjacent environment and amenities to help them make informed decisions. Secondly, our application creates a machine learning model with random forest regression to predict hotel holiday prices."

    "text": "Although our application performs a reliable prediction for tourists, there are still several limitations that we can improve in the future.\n\nThere are only 100 results to scrape available in Expedia so that the sample size is small. The number of available hotels and hotel prices vary in real time based on the bookings. Since we web-scraped the lists of the available hotels, we did not get to the website of each hotel with more detailed information. If we could, there would be more internal features as predictors in the regression model.\nThe Miami-Dade Open Data Hub has limited resources. We supposed to find the crime data as a predictor, but there is no available public dataset for us to use. The datasets for transportation type are also limited. Since Miami and adjacent cities have trolley lines, we did not find datasets for trolley stops."
