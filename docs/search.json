Web Scraping\nTo retrieve the hotel prices during the Christmas holiday season in Miami, we web-scraped Expedia.com, an official website of booking stays and flights, by selecting a one-night stay from December 24th to December 25th in 2023 with one traveler and one room. We used Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract the information of hotel names, ratings, amenities, and prices from the HTML tags and classes and generated a dataframe with the cleaned data.\n\n\n\nExpedia Query Result Screenshot\n\n\n\n\n2. Google Geocoding API\nSince the web-scraped results do not include specific addresses or coordinates of hotels, we used Google Geocoding API to geocode the addresses from the hotel names. Then we withdrawed the coordinates from the geocoding results and joined them by hotel names into the hotel’s dataframe to create a geodataframe with geometries.\n\n\n3. Census API\nIt is possible that a hotel’s price is related with the wealth level of the belonged neighborhood. Therefore, we retrieved the median household income data by census tracts and joined it with the hotel dataframe.\n\n\n4. ArcGIS Open Data\nSpatial features of parks, shorelines, matro stations, trash complaints, abandoned cars and properties and sexual offenders are all retrieved from County of Miami-Dade ArcGIS Open Data Portal. We performed a nearest-neighborhood analysis to calculate the distance from each hotel to its nearest neighbor in the these datasets. We did a logarithm of the distances to normalize the distribution of distance values."

    "text": "Spatial Distribution of Miami Hotels\nTo begin with, by observing the visualization of the spatial distribution pattern of Miami hotels, we can see that the hotels are clustered in the prime areas of the city center and along the coastal prime locations. The density of hotels in prime locations may reflect higher real estate and accommodation costs, affecting price points and target demographics. Conversely, the sparser hotel layouts outside these clusters might indicate a market oriented towards budget-conscious travelers, or those seeking a more localized experience away from typical tourist hotspots. The spatial analysis is crucial for stakeholders in the hotel industry during holiday periods like Christmas, including hotel operators, city planners, and tourism boards. It allows them to understand market saturation, identify areas with development potential, and formulate competitive positioning strategies. More importantly, for potential visitors, such a map is a valuable tool in planning their accommodation, enabling them to choose lodging based on proximity to safety. desired attractions and activities.\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook"

    "text": "Exploring Predictors for Hotel Price Prediction Model\n\nAmenities\nTo examine the data distribution and outliers which could have impacts on our prediction model, we plot a violin plot of hotel amenities and price distribution, and average price per amenity. Understanding how different amenities affect price elasticity is crucial for price prediction. If some amenities, such as swimming pools, are associated with high price elasticity, hotels might increase prices during Christmas based on anticipated demand. Violin plots show the breadth and density of price distribution, helping us understand how different amenities affect price fluctuations. For hotels with only a swimming pool, we observe a wide range of prices with a low concentration but some high outliers, possibly reflecting a high-end market presence, which can be filtered out in later prediction models. For hotels with both breakfast and a swimming pool, the price distribution is narrower, indicating a more uniform pricing for this combination of amenities. For hotels offering only breakfast, the violin plot is almost a straight line, indicating little variation in prices, which could be due to fewer data points or extreme concentration in this category’s pricing.\nThis histogram plot shows the relationship between the number of hotels with different amenities and their ratings. It is evident that hotels with swimming pool amenities are the most numerous, mainly concentrated in the mid-to-high rating range. Hotels offering both breakfast and swimming pools are the next in number, but they are more concentrated in the higher rating segment. Hotels only offering breakfast are relatively fewer, with ratings concentrated in the 7 rating. This indicates that hotels with swimming pools are more common in the Miami market, possibly due to the warm climate and tourism-oriented market. Swimming pools, as an attraction for tourists, may have significant positive relationship with a hotel’s overall rating. In contrast, hotels offering both breakfast and swimming pools, though fewer in number, tend to receive higher ratings, possibly indicating better service quality and customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Household Income\nThis plot shows the relationship between hotel prices, the median household income of the neighborhood, and hotel ratings. It is evident that hotels with higher prices are more likely located in areas with higher median incomes and these hotels usually have higher ratings as well. For predicting pricing strategies during high-demand periods in Christmas holiday, this dataset can help more accurately help building prediction model for which hotels near certain areas might increase their charges and the potential extent of these increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance-Based Features\nThe maps present the distance of each spatial predictor variables and the location of hotels in Miami. The specific variables include the logarithmic distance to the nearest park, subway station, trash complaints, abandoned cars and property, sex offenders, and the coastline. From the chart, we can observe the relative position of hotels to the city’s public resources (parks and metro stations) and environmental issues (trash complaints and abandoned property), as well as their proximity to safety-related factors (distribution of sex offenders) and natural landscapes (shoreline). These predictors is crucial for the hotel business, as it not only affects customers’ preferences for hotel locations but also may impact the hotel’s selling price.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis set of scatter plots reveals various aspects of the correlation between hotel prices and geographical predictor’s location. The plots show the relationship between hotel prices and the logarithmic distance to subway stations, parks, garbage complaint points, abandoned properties, criminals, and coastlines. Among these, the most significant correlations are a negative relationship between prices and the logarithmic distance to the coastline, and a positive relationship with the logarithmic distance to sexual offenders, indicating that proximity to the beach is a key factor affecting prices. Other variables, like proximity to subway stations and abandoned properties, also show a slight trend in price variation, but their correlation is not as strong. These findings provide important insights for predicting hotel price patterns during high-demand periods in Christmas holiday."

    "text": "We created a list containing the column names we want to keep,including the price of hotels, rating of hotels on Expedia, mdeian household income of census tract, hotel’s logged distance to parks, logged distance to metro stations, logged distance to 311 calls of transhes and abandoned cars, logged distance to offenders and logged distance to shoreline, amenities of hotels and census tract of where the hotel locates. These columns will be the data prepared for our prediction model. And then we use this list to select the specified columns along with the ‘geometry’ column from the hotels_census_cleaned DataFrame. In order to avoid outliers that decrease the predicting capability of our model, we filerted out extremely expensive hotel prices and negative median household income values.\nWe plot a correlation matrix plot using heatmap to study the intercorrelation of all variables. According to the plot, the dependent variable of price is most related with median household income (0.43) of the tract, followed by the logged distance to offenders (0.38). Logged distances to shorelines (-0.33) and logged distances to parks (-0.4) are negatively related with the hotel price. This result is out of expectation, for we assume the major reason that people visiting Miami is for enjoying the beaches. Some predicters are highly correlated as well, for example the logged distances to parks and logged distances to shorelines has a correlation of 0.65, logged distances to trashes and logged distances to abandoned cars has correlation of 0.6.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe categorized the columns we selected previously into numerical and categorical columns. Numerical columns include rating, MedHHInc, logDistParks, logDistMetro, logDistTrash, logDistAbandoned, logDistOffender, and logDistShoreline. For categorical columns we only choose the census tract. To process the two distinct categories of column, we used two different methods. We use StandardScaler() to standardize (scale to mean=0 and variance=1) the numerical columns specified in the list num_cols. This is commonly done to ensure that numerical features are on a similar scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms. We use OneHotEncoder to perform one-hot encoding on the categorical columns specified in the list cat_cols. One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into binary vectors, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms that require numerical input. The handle_unknown=“ignore” parameter is used to handle unknown categories that may appear in the test data. If a new category is encountered during the transformation of the test data, it will be ignored rather than raising an error.\nWe create a scikit-learn pipeline out of processed data from the previous steps and fed the data into the RandomForestRegressor for training or prediction. The RandomForestRegressor is a machine learning model from the scikit-learn library. In our case, it’s configured to use 10 decision trees (n_estimators=10) and a fixed random state (random_state=42) for reproducibility. After that we split the data in to 30/70 for testing/training and logged our hotel price. Finally, fitting a model on the training set and then calculate the score on the test set. Our final output score for the test set is around 0.45. This result indicates that our model is not a very predictive model, it can only predict 45% of the hotel prices in the testing set based on our predictors.\n\n\n0.4513026136517557\n\n\nTo assess the error of our prediction, we exponentiated the logged hotel price back and rerun the regression to get the predicted price of hotels. The error of prediction percentage is calculated using (predicted price – actual price)/ actual price* 100.\nTo better interpretate our errors, we plot a scatterplot. Most points of the price are clustered around the prediction line, only two out obvious outliers. One we predict to have a price exceeding $400, but the actual price is only around $150. Another hotel price we predict to be only $400, but the actual price is nearly $700.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also created a map with errors to help understanding the relationship with location and error in prediction. As from the graph, the hotels in downtown have lower error, but hotels by the beach showed significantly difference from the predicted values.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn importance barplot is created to visualize the importance of each selected predictor to the hotel price. In numerical predictors, distance to metro station is the most crucial to influence hotel prices and distance to trash is the least important. For categorical predictors of census tracts, they do not vary much, all have little importance to the hotel prices."

    "text": "Although our application performs a reliable prediction for tourists, there are still several limitations that we can improve in the future.\n\nThere are only 100 results to scrape available in Expedia so that the sample size is small. The number of available hotels and hotel prices vary in real time based on the bookings. Since we web-scraped the lists of the available hotels, we did not get to the website of each hotel with more detailed information. If we could, there would be more internal features as predictors in the regression model.\nThe Miami-Dade Open Data Hub has limited resources. We supposed to find the crime data as a predictor, but there is no available public dataset for us to use. The datasets for transportation type are also limited. Since Miami and adjacent cities have trolley lines, we did not find datasets for trolley stops."
